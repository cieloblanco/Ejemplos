Leveraging Automated Sentiment Analysis in Software Engineering
accuracies in those few tools available for the purpose. We conduct an in-depth qualitative study to identify the difficulties responsible for such low accuracy. Majority of the exposed difficulties are then carefully addressed in developing SentiStrength-SE, a tool for improved sentiment analysis especially designed for application in the software engineering domain. Using a benchmark dataset consisting of 5,600 manually annotated JIRA issue comments, we carry out both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of our tool. SentiStrength-SE achieves 73.85% precision and 85% recall, which are significantly higher than a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool we compare with.
