An Efficient Algorithm for Computation of MHD Flow Ensembles
An efficient algorithm is proposed and studied for computing flow ensembles of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows under uncertainties in initial or boundary data. The ensemble average of J realizations is approximated through a clever algorithm (adapted from a breakthrough idea of Jiang and Layton []) that, at each time step, uses the same matrix for each of the J systems solves. Hence, preconditioners need to be built only once per time step, and the algorithm can take advantage of block linear solvers. Additionally, an Els√§sser variable formulation is used, which allows for a stable decoupling of each MHD system at each time step. We prove stability and convergence of the algorithm, and test it with two numerical experiments.
