Predictive Variables for Agile Development Merging Cloud Computing Services
Cloud Technology is a most challenging modern area in the field of modern technologies in which assets (e.g., CPU and capacity) can be rented and discharged by the clients through internet on-demand basis. The cloud computing has been giving virtual computing services to a little, medium and extensive industries, and services, for example, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). Cloud computing has a great combination with the agile software development as a research area. Many researchers worked in Agile Cloud field. The software industries are using the agile methodology for efficient software development need some platform to get quick feedback from the client. Therefore, the agile-cloud is a great combination for it but due to security reasons that directly influence the less adoption of cloud in software industries. This paper reports the survey results of software industries. The total of seven IT industries and many professionals was involved in this paper. However, this paper also contributes and reveals how existing issues can affect agile-cloud adoption for efficient software development. Furthermore, we do not find any type of survey conducted in Pakistan's software industries-related to cloud-agile adoption.
