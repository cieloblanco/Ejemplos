Hand Gesture Recognition for Human Computer Interaction
The use of a physical controller like mouse, keyboard for human computer interaction hinders natural interface as there is a strong barrier between the user and computer. In this paper, we have designed a robust marker- less hand gesture recognition system which can efficiently track both static and dynamic hand gestures. Our system translates the detected gesture into actions such as opening websites and launching applications like VLC Player and PowerPoint. The dynamic gesture is used to shuffle through the slides in presentation. Our results show that an intuitive HCI can be achieved with minimum hardware requirements.
