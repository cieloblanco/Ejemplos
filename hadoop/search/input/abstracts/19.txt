Emotions and Affect in Human Factors and Human–Computer Interaction: Taxonomy, Theories, Approaches, and Methods
This chapter presents an overview of emotional and affective components in human factors (HF) and human–computer interaction (HCI). First, the definitions of terminologies are clarified. After describing neural and cognitive mechanisms of affect, I provide theories of affective effects so that researchers can apply them to their research areas and develop their own theory further. Then, the chapter focuses on introducing and comparing four different approaches to Affective Sciences in HF/HCI, including Emotional Design, Hedonomics, Kansei Engineering, and Affective Computing. After delineating advantages and disadvantages of affect induction and detection methodologies, theoretical and practical issues and future works of this domain are discussed. This short review is expected to guide HF/HCI researchers and practitioners who begin to study emotions and affect, and to facilitate communication about emotions and affect within the HF/HCI community.
