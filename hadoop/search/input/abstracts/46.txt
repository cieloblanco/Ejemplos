Active Contour Image Segmentation Method for Training Talents 0f Computer Graphics and Image Processing Technology
Image segmentation is a key technology in the field of image processing and computer image processing. Among them, segmentation methods based on active contour models have developed rapidly in recent years due to their effective processing of complex images such as medical images, and have achieved significant results in medical, military, and industrial fields. This article mainly introduces the training of computer graphics and image processing technology and the method of active contour image segmentation. This article focuses on the study of image segmentation methods, and focuses on the segmentation methods based on active contour models. Firstly, it summarizes two types of segmentation methods based on edge and region, and summarizes their advantages and disadvantages. Then, the segmentation method based on active contour model is studied, and several typical active contour models are comprehensively compared. Finally, the local binary fitting model and the local Gaussian distribution fitting energy model were improved and simulated. And from the development of computer graphics and image processing technology to analyze some methods and means of training this professional talent. The experimental results of this article show that the active contour image segmentation algorithm can not only ensure the image segmentation algorithm, but also reduce the number of iterations and shorten the image segmentation time. Compared with the CV, LBF, and LGIF models introduced in this article, its computational efficiency is increased by 9.2 times, 2.64 Times and 1.44 times.
