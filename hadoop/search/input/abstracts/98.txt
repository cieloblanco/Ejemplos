Study on the Effect of EPL on Programing, Computing Thinking and Problem Solving Ability of Programing Education
In this paper, it is practically difficult to obtain programming language education without having an algorithmic thinking ability, computing thinking ability, and problem solving ability of students with relatively low basic education. The results showed that students who took program language education in parallel with the EPL(Educational Programing Language), Scratch, compared to without using Scratch found to be helpful in improving their programming amd computing thinking ability, and problem-solving abilities as well as their satisfaction. This not only gave students confidence in their hard-thinking programming practices, but also helped prevent them from falling out of the middle.
