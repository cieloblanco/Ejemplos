Mobile Augmented Reality as a Teaching Medium in an Introductory Computer Graphics Course
Teaching computer graphics is challenging since the subject requires a diverse range of skills such as mathematics, programming, and spatial reasoning. Researchers have attempted to address this by investigating different teaching methodologies and proposing various learning tools. However, most tools proposed previously are desktop-based and involve manipulation of 3D scenes using mouse or other similar interaction devices which use the same concepts as those of modelling and animation tools. Therefore, there is a need for an approach using handheld devices which allows interaction with the real environment so that inter-action with 3D scenes would be easier, more natural, accessible, and intuitive. One potential approach is to use Augmented Reality (AR) technologies using mobile devices as it enables intuitive interactions and integrate virtual objects in a real-world view. In this research, we review previous research on tools for computer graphics education and suggest how augmented reality can be used to improve students learning of computer graphics.
