Habituation effects in computer security warning
Security warning is a form of computer dialog communication that is used to inform the users on the risks of allowing random applications to run on a computer system. Accordingly, it is specifically designed to impersonate a legitimate security alerting function (e.g., notify, warn and advice) to a user about the consequence effect of an action. However, most of the computer users tend to ignore those security warnings conveying the same message over and over again. This eventually leads to habituation. Considering the fact that there is a significant lack of focus been paid to address this issue, the main objective of this paper is to describe and summarize the related studies on usersâ€™ habituation to the security warnings. This paper presents a systematic literature review to explore the current key issues, challenges and the possible solutions related to habituation effects in security warnings. It is expected that this paper could contribute to a more complete understanding of the habituation effects in security warnings and eventually bring benefits to the research communities or general publics.
