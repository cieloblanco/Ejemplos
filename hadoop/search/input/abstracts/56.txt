A Linear-Time Algorithm for Seeds Computation
A seed in a word is a relaxed version of a period in which the occurrences of the repeating subword may overlap. Our first contribution is a linear-time algorithm computing a linear-size representation of all seeds of a word (the number of seeds might be quadratic). In particular, one can easily derive the shortest seed and the number of seeds from our representation. Thus, we solve an open problem stated in a survey by Smyth from 2000 and improve upon a previous O(n log n)-time algorithm by Iliopoulos et al. from 1996. Our approach is based on combinatorial relations between seeds and subword complexity (used here for the first time in the context of seeds).
