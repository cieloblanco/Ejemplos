Use of Augmented Reality in Chemistry Education
The purpose of this article is to analyze the current trends in the use of the augmented reality in the chemistry education and to identify the promising areas for the introduction of AR-technologies to support the chemistry education in Ukrainian educational institutions. The article is aimed at solving such problems as: the generalization and analysis of the scientific researches results on the use of the augmented reality in the chemistry education, the characteristics of the modern AR-tools in the chemistry education and the forecasting of some possible areas of the development and improvement of the Ukrainian tools of the augmented reality in the chemistry education. The object of research is the augmented reality, and the subject is the use of the augmented reality in the chemistry learning. As a result of the study, it has been found that AR-technologies are actively used in the chemistry education and their effectiveness has been proven, but there are still no Ukrainian software products in this field. Frequently AR-technologies of the chemistry education are used for 3D visualization of the structure of atoms, molecules, crystalline lattices. The study has made it possible to conclude that there is a significant demand for the chemistry education with the augmented reality that is available via the mobile devices, and accordingly the need to develop the appropriate tools to support the chemistry education at schools and universities. The most promising thing is the development of methodological recommendations for the implementation of laboratory works, textbooks, popular scientific literature on chemistry with the use of the augmented reality technologies and the creation of the simulators for working with the chemical equipment and utensils using the augmented reality.
