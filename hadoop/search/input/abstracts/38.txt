Sharing remote sessions of a user interface and/or graphics of a computer
Methods, systems, and techniques for sharing a remoted user interface are described. Example embodiments provide a Remote Session Sharing Protocol (“RSSP”) for sharing a remoted user interface and/or graphics of a same computer system operating system or application. Use of the RSSP enables server computing systems to optimize the utilization of frame buffers and state information when multiple clients connect to the same remote session (e.g., connect to the same user interface of an application or operating system) at substantially the same time.
