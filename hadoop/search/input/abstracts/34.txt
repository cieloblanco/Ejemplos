Distinguishing computer graphics from natural images using convolution neural networks
This paper presents a deep-learning method for distinguishing computer generated graphics from real photographic images. The proposed method uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a custom pooling layer to optimize current best-performing algorithms feature extraction scheme. Local estimates of class probabilities are computed and aggregated to predict the label of the whole picture. We evaluate our work on recent photo-realistic computer graphics and show that it outperforms state of the art methods for both local and full image classification.
