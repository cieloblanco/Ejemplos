Head-mounted gesture controlled interface for human-computer interaction
This paper proposes a novel human-computer interaction system exploiting gesture recognition. It is based on the combined usage of an head-mounted display and a multi-modal sensor setup including also a depth camera. The depth information is used both to seamlessly include augmented reality elements into the real world and as input for a novel gesture-based interface. Reliable gesture recognition is obtained through a real-time algorithm exploiting novel feature descriptors arranged in a multi-dimensional structure fed to an SVM classifier. The system has been tested with various augmented reality applications including an innovative human-computer interaction scheme where virtual windows can be arranged into the real world observed by the user.
