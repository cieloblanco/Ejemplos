IoT Based Multitasking Games and Entertainment Arcade Station using Raspberry-Pi
The world lives in a technology revolution that started from invention the computer system, the Internet and now in the Internet of Things (IoT) or Internet of every things (IoE). This revolution impacted the human life strongly, by depending on this technology to enhance our life and inventing new products depending on information technology like social media, mobile applications, video games and so on. This research will present the simplest, yet efficient way to build a classic Arcade Machine by using a Raspberry Pi development board, also this research will highlight how to build and install all related components, such as body structure, buttons and joysticks, programming the Raspberry Pi and adding the video game files. Later, the research will explain how to connect the Arcade Machine to the Internet for remote operation by using MCU ESP8266, relays, and the Wi-Fi function on the Raspberry Pi itself. Beside the video games, the machine can behave as an ordinary computer for the Internet browsing, music listening, image processing, documenting or doing some programing tasks, as the Raspbian operating system has python programming apps and it is possible to install any other programing language needed to execute tasks on Raspberry Pi microcontroller.
