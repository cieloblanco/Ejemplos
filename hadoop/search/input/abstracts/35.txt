Forensics feature analysis in quaternion wavelet domain for distinguishing photographic images and computer graphics
In this paper, a novel set of features based on Quaternion Wavelet Transform (QWT) is proposed for digital image forensics. Compared with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Contourlet Wavelet Transform (CWT), QWT produces the parameters, i.e., one magnitude and three angles, which provide more valuable information to distinguish photographic (PG) images and computer generated (CG) images. Some theoretical analysis are done and comparative experiments are made. The corresponding results show that the proposed scheme achieves 18 percents’ improvements on the detection accuracy than Farid’s scheme and 12 percents than Özparlak’s scheme. It may be the first time to introduce QWT to image forensics, but the improvements are encouraging.
